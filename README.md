# CODE QUIZ
## Russell Morgan


This weeks challenge was to create a multiple choice questions that test your javascript knowledge. We were given an animated video of a working model to help with the design. This challenge was definitly challenging. 

The quiz starts with the instructions being presented to the user and they click the 'Start Quiz' button. Five questions are displayed, the user selects rheir answer and then click the submit button. Each question is graded and either 'Correct' of 'Wrong' is displayed at the bottom. 

The quiz stops when either the user has answered all the questions of time runs out. Their score is the time left. They are then given the chance to save their score by entering their initials, the score is captured from the screen.
